= NextCloud on Docker with LetsEcnrypt SSL, PostgreSQL backend, Collabora online myoffice, Cron-Support

After in my perception the official examples did not provide a working Docker example to host a NextCloud in production environment, this is my try.

## Features

* Based on link:https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/blob/master/.examples/docker-compose/with-nginx-proxy/postgres/apache/docker-compose.yml[NextCloud PostgreSQL Apache example]
* link:https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/blob/master/.examples/dockerfiles/cron/apache/supervisord.conf[Cron-based background Tasks using supervisord]
* Letsencrypt support
* [Collabora Online myoffice (CODE) integration](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/pull/630)

## How to get it running

To get this running, have an installed `docker-compose` available and:

1. register get two dynamic domains i.e. at https://freedns.org
- one for your nextcloud: `mynextcloud.mooo.com`
- one only to host Collabora: `myoffice.mooo.com`
2. publicy expose TCP port 80 & 443 of your host in router
3. Adjust all `pass:[[##VALUES##]]` in the files: `docker-compose.yml` and `db.env`
4. Run `sudo docker-compose up --build`
5. Activate Collabora pluing in nextcloud & define pass:[https://[##myoffice.mooo.com##]] as URL

## How to upgrade & rebuild your installation
Simply do the following. Due to the Docker volumes this will retain all your data and even your running login sessions.

```
   $ sudo docker-compose down
   $ sudo docker-compose build --pull
   $ sudo docker-compose up -d
```
